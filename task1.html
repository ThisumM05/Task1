    <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 150%;">
        At its most basic, neuroscience is the study of the nervous system – from structure to function, development to
        degeneration, in health and in disease. It covers the whole nervous system, with a primary focus on the brain.
        Incredibly complex, our brains define who we are and what we do. They store our memories and allow us to learn
        from them. Our brain cells and their circuits create new thoughts, ideas and movements and reinforce old ones.
        Their individual connections (synapses) are responsible for a baby’s first steps and every record-breaking
        athletic performance, with each thought and movement requiring exquisitely precise timing and connections.

        <br><br>

        Human brains have 86 billion neurons (8.6 x 1010); neuroscientists investigate how these connect with each other
        and with other parts of the nervous system and the rest of the body. King’s Neuroscience seeks to understand the
        brain in health and disease. We want to find out how our nervous systems develop, and what can go wrong.
        Combining different approaches with new technologies, we lead research into treatments for diseases and
        disorders affecting the nervous system. We focus on key conditions affecting the nervous system, from childhood
        epilepsy through to Alzheimer’s disease

    </u>

    <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 150%;">
        Neuroplasticity, also known as neural plasticity or brain plasticity, is a process that involves adaptive
        structural and functional changes to the brain. It is defined as the ability of the nervous system to change its
        activity in response to intrinsic or extrinsic stimuli by reorganizing its structure, functions, or connections
        after injuries, such as a stroke or traumatic brain injury (TBI). This activity describes neuroplasticity, the
        evaluation and management of neuroplasticity, and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in improving
        care for patients.

    </u>

    <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 150%;">
        Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and
        act. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make healthy choices.1 Mental health is
        important at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood.
        <br><br>
        <b style="font-family: 'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif;">Why is mental health
            important for overall health?</b>
        <br><br>
        Mental and physical health are equally important components of overall health. For example, depression increases
        the risk for many types of physical health problems, particularly long-lasting conditions like diabetes, heart
        disease, and stroke. Similarly, the presence of chronic conditions can increase the risk for mental illness.

        Your brain is an essential organ that allows you to perceive and interact with the world around you. It receives
        and interprets all the sensory information you encounter. A range of conditions can affect your brain. You can
        support your brain health by sleeping well, eating a healthy diet, exercising and making other healthy lifestyle
        choices. If you suspect that you or a loved one has symptoms related to a brain condition, speak with a
        healthcare provider.
